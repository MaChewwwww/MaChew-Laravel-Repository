- **Basic Authentication**: A simple login and registration system.
- **CRUD Operations**: Basic create, read, update, and delete functionality for a resource (e.g., tasks or posts).
- **Database Integration**: Implemented using Laravel migrations and Eloquent ORM for database interactions.
- **Blade Templates**: Used Blade templating engine for rendering views.
- **MVC Structure**: Following the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern to manage the app's logic, views, and data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With
